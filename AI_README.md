# 🎮 Wood Block Puzzle AI - Simple Guide

## What is this AI?

This is an **Artificial Intelligence** that learns to play the Wood Block Puzzle game by itself! Think of it like teaching a computer to get really good at the game through practice.

## 🧠 How does the AI work?

### The AI's "Brain"
- The AI has a **neural network** (like a simplified computer brain)
- It looks at the game board and available blocks
- It tries to figure out the best move to make
- It learns from its mistakes and gets better over time

### What the AI sees
The AI can see:
- 📋 **The game board** - which squares are filled and which are empty
- 🧩 **Available blocks** - what shapes it can place
- 📊 **Game info** - current score, how long since last line clear

## 🎯 How the AI learns

### Training Process
1. **Practice Games**: The AI plays thousands of practice games
2. **Trial and Error**: It tries different moves and sees what happens
3. **Learning**: Good moves get remembered, bad moves get avoided
4. **Getting Better**: Over time, it becomes much better at the game

### What makes a "good" move?
The AI learns that good moves:
- ✅ **Clear lines** (rows, columns, or 3x3 squares) - **HUGE REWARDS!**
- ✅ **Keep options open** for future moves
- ✅ **Use space efficiently** without creating gaps
- ❌ **Avoid** moves that block future opportunities

## 🏆 AI Skill Levels

The AI progresses through different skill levels:

### 🟢 Beginner (0-100 points average)
- Learning basic block placement
- Understanding how to clear simple lines
- Making lots of random moves

### 🟡 Intermediate (100-500 points average)  
- Starting to plan ahead
- Better at completing lines
- Less random, more strategic

### 🟠 Advanced (500-1000 points average)
- Recognizes complex patterns
- Sets up chain reactions (clearing multiple lines)
- Thinks several moves ahead

### 🔴 Expert (1000+ points average)
- Master-level strategic play
- Complex pattern recognition
- Optimal space utilization

## 🎮 Using the AI

### Training the AI
1. **Click "Start Training"** - Let the AI practice by playing games
2. **Watch it learn** - You can see it play in real-time
3. **Set episode count** - More episodes = more practice = better AI
4. **Monitor progress** - Check if scores are improving

### Playing with the AI
1. **Click "Start AI Play"** - Watch the trained AI play your current game
2. **Learn from it** - See what moves it makes
3. **Compare strategies** - Notice how it approaches different situations

### Saving/Loading
- **Save Model** - Keep your trained AI for later
- **Load Model** - Restore a previously trained AI
- **Download/Upload** - Share AI models between devices

## 📊 Understanding AI Performance

### Good Signs
- ✅ **Scores going up** over time
- ✅ **More lines cleared** per game
- ✅ **Fewer random moves** and more strategic ones
- ✅ **Reaching higher skill levels**

### What the numbers mean
- **Episode**: One practice game
- **Best Score**: Highest score the AI ever achieved
- **Average Score**: Typical performance over recent games
- **Lines Cleared**: How many lines the AI completes

## 🛠️ Simple Tips

### For Training
- **More episodes = better AI** (try 500-2000 episodes)
- **Visual training is slower** but fun to watch
- **Let it finish training** for best results

### For Testing
- **Test the AI** regularly to see improvement
- **Save good models** when performance is high
- **Compare different training sessions**

### For Playing
- **Watch the AI's moves** to learn new strategies
- **Try copying successful patterns** in your own games
- **Use it as a teacher** to improve your skills

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: How long does training take?**
A: Depends on episode count. 500 episodes ≈ 5-10 minutes.

**Q: Will the AI always get better?**
A: Usually yes, but sometimes it needs more practice or different settings.

**Q: Can I stop training early?**
A: Yes! You can pause/stop anytime and the AI keeps what it learned.

**Q: What's a good score for the AI?**
A: Beginner AI: 50-200, Good AI: 500-1000, Expert AI: 2000+

**Q: Why does the AI make weird moves sometimes?**
A: It's exploring new strategies. This helps it learn better moves.

## 🎯 Quick Start Guide

1. **First time**: Start with 500 episodes of training
2. **Watch**: Enable visual training to see it learn
3. **Test**: Use "Test Performance" to check how good it got
4. **Play**: Let it play your game to see expert moves
5. **Save**: Save good models so you don't lose progress

## 🏆 Goals

The ultimate goal is to create an AI that:
- Consistently scores 2000+ points
- Clears multiple lines efficiently
- Makes strategic, non-random moves
- Teaches human players better strategies
