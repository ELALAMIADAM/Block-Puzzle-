## üöÄ How Everything Works Together

### 1. **Starting the App** (`index.js`)
```javascript
// Starts the React app and shows it on the webpage
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

### 2. **Game Flow**
1. **App.js** decides which screen to show
2. **MainMenu.js** lets you choose what to do
3. **GameView.js** runs the human game
4. **AILearningView.js** runs the AI training

### 3. **AI Learning Process**
1. **DQNEnvironment** creates a practice game
2. **DQNAgent** tries to play the game
3. **Environment** gives rewards for good/bad moves
4. **Agent** learns from rewards and gets better
5. **Repeat thousands of times** until AI is smart

### 4. **AI Playing Process**
1. **Trained Agent** looks at real game board
2. **Calculates** best move using learned knowledge
3. **Makes move** on actual game
4. **Repeats** until game over

## üéØ Key Concepts Explained Simply

### Neural Networks
- **What**: The AI's "brain" made of math
- **How**: Takes game info ‚Üí processes it ‚Üí outputs best move
- **Like**: A very complex calculator that learns patterns

### Training/Learning
- **What**: AI playing practice games to get better
- **How**: Try move ‚Üí see result ‚Üí remember ‚Üí improve
- **Like**: Learning to drive by practicing in a simulator

### Rewards
- **What**: Points the AI gets for good/bad moves
- **How**: Good moves = positive points, bad moves = negative points
- **Like**: Treats for a pet when it behaves correctly

### Episodes
- **What**: One complete practice game from start to finish
- **How**: AI plays until game over, learns from it, starts new game
- **Like**: One practice round in sports training

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Understand the Code

2. **Then look at**: `GameView.js` - see how humans play
3. **Finally explore**: `DQNAgent.js` - see how AI learns

### If you know some programming:
1. **Study the data flow**: How game state moves between components
2. **Understand the AI loop**: State ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Reward ‚Üí Learning
3. **Explore the neural network**: How the AI "brain" is structured

### If you're experienced:
1. **Analyze the architecture**: React components + TensorFlow.js AI

3. **Examine optimizations**: Prioritized replay, curriculum learning, etc.

## üìö Learning Resources

### To understand the game:
- Play it manually first to understand the rules
- Watch the AI play to see strategies

### To understand the AI:
- Read `AI_README.md` for AI-specific details
- Look at training graphs to see learning progress
- Try different training settings to see effects

### To understand the code:
- Start with simpler files like `ScoreDisplay.js`
- Use browser developer tools to see component tree
- Add `console.log()` statements to trace execution
